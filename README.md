# RNG Sorter
This assembly language program generates random numbers between a set range, then uses merge sort to arrange them in non-descending order. After displaying the sorted array, the program then displays how many times each integer within the provided range appeared.

The number of values is preset to 200 and their range preset to between 15 and 50, but these can be adjusted by changing the global variables `ARRAYSIZE`, `LO`, and `HI`.
